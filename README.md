### Render example with DarkBASIC
![7_RT_5rays_5bounces_render](images/7_RT_5rays_5bounces_render.bmp) <br/>
Basic RayTracing 1920x1080. Calculations lasted 45 minutes.

3D Scene for reference.<br/>
Artefact on the right as the 3D engine doesn't handle well 1920x1080, resulting in a not-updated-until-redrawn background.<br/>
3D engine doesn't draw big sphere as a sphere, explaining the difference of ground height (supposed to be a large sphere).
